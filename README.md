This C++ project implements a basic car rental system using MySQL database for storing car information and managing availability. Let's break down the key components and functionalities of the project:

MySQL Database Setup:

A MySQL database named mydb is used to store car information.
The cars table within the database has columns for Serial, Brand, Model, Rent, and Avail (availability).
Car Class:

The Car class represents a car object with attributes such as serial number, brand, model, rental price, and availability.
It has member functions to retrieve these attributes.
Database Connectivity:

The project establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the MySQL Connector/C++ library.
The connection parameters (HOST, USER, PW, DB) are defined at the beginning of the code.
Function to Check Availability (isAvail):

This function checks the availability of a car in the database based on its serial number.
It executes a SQL query to retrieve the availability status (Avail) of the car.
Main Function:

The main function initializes the MySQL connection and displays a menu for the user to interact with the car rental system.
It creates instances of the Car class representing different cars available for rent.
The main loop allows the user to select a car by entering its serial number.
When a car is selected, the system checks its availability and updates the database accordingly.
If the car is available, the system displays its details (brand, model, rental price).
After the user selects a car or chooses to exit, the program terminates.
Database Operations:

The program performs database operations such as inserting car data into the database and retrieving car information for display.
SQL queries are constructed as strings and executed using the mysql_query function.
Error Handling:

The program includes error handling for database operations. If an error occurs during database queries, it prints the error message to the console.
Overall, this project demonstrates a simple car rental system implemented in C++ with MySQL database integration for data storage and management. It showcases basic functionalities such as checking car availability, selecting a car for rent, and updating the database accordingly.
